        <h2> History </h2>
        <p id="history-intro"> 
                Dubbed the “Grand Canyon of the Arkansas River” by the first American explorers, the (almost) ten-mile-long Royal Gorge near Cañon City in south-central Colorado has a narrow width of 30 feet at the bottom, with depths occasionally exceeding 1,200 feet. It was the ancient wintering location for Ute Native Americans and was the site of intense corporate feuds such as a battle over railway track. With its iconic red granite formations and extreme height, the Royal Gorge stands as Colorado’s iconic landmark.
