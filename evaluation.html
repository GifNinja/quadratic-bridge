            <h2> Evaluation </h2>
            <p> The <strong> precision </strong> of the curve is limited by one of many factors, including: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> photo skewness – The photo is slightly higher on the right than on the left, skewing the parabola. This can be verified by the fact that in the image shown in step 3, the bridge appears to be slightly above the x-axis at the right tower, but it is slightly below the x-axis at the left tower, indicating the skewness of the photo. As such, the symmetry of the parabola cannot be preserved. This is why the parabola and the bridge in step 8 is imprecise at the left tower. </li>
                <li> inability to calculate height of bridge from the walkway – as seen in the photo, the base of the bridge is actually not at the walkway, but beneath it. Therefore, the given value of 150 feet is not representative of the actual height of the tower from the bridge, and thus in the process, a crude estimate of 75m was made. </li>
                <li> inability to align x-axis with the Arkansas River, hence making it impossible to curve fit with the river as the x-axis.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2> Justification </h2>
            <ul>
                <li> The <em> a </em> value, which determines the concavity of the parabola, is on the order of magnitude of 10^-4, accounting for the shallowness of the bridge. </li>
                <li> The <em> b </em> value is zero because the y-axis is aligned with the axis of symmetry.</li>
                <li> The <em> c </em> value is also zero because the x-axis is aligned with the minimum point of the graph. </li>
            </ul>
